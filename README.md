# 📚 Library Management System

## 🌟 Overview
This project is a simple **Library Management System** implemented in Dart. It allows library administrators to manage books and users, and provides basic functionalities like borrowing and returning books. The project is designed for demonstration and learning purposes.

## ✨ Features
1. **📖 Manage Books**
   - ➕ Add new books to the library.
   - 📋 Display book details, including their borrowing status.

2. **👤 Manage Users**
   - ➕ Add new users to the library system.
   - 📋 Display user information.

3. **🔄 Borrow and Return Books**
   - 📥 Borrow a book by providing its ID and the user's ID.
   - 📤 Return a borrowed book by providing its ID.

4. **⚠️ Error Handling**
   - Provides user-friendly messages for invalid operations, such as borrowing a book that is already borrowed or returning a book that was not borrowed.

## 🏗️ Code Structure
### 📂 Classes
- **📘 Book**: Represents a book in the library with properties like ID, title, and borrowing status.
- **👤 User**: Represents a library user with properties like ID and name.
- **🏢 Library**: Manages the list of books and users and provides methods for library operations.

### 🔑 Key Methods
- **addBook(id, title)**: ➕ Adds a book to the library.
- **addUser(id, name)**: ➕ Adds a user to the library system.
- **borrowBook(bookId, userId)**: 📥 Marks a book as borrowed by a user.
- **returnBook(bookId)**: 📤 Marks a book as returned.
- **displayLibraryInfo()**: 📋 Displays the current state of the library.

## 🛠️ Example Usage
Below is an example demonstrating how to use the library system:

```dart
void main() {
  Library library = Library();

  // Add books
  library.addBook(1, 'Crime and Punishment');
  library.addBook(2, 'The Idiot');
  library.addBook(3, 'The Brothers Karamazov');

  // Add users
  library.addUser(1, 'Saadany');
  library.addUser(2, 'Shrouk');

  // Borrow books
  library.borrowBook(1, 1); // Saadany borrows Crime and Punishment
  library.borrowBook(2, 2); // Shrouk borrows The Idiot

  // Attempt to borrow already borrowed book
  library.borrowBook(2, 1); // Error

  // Return books
  library.returnBook(1); // Saadany returns Crime and Punishment
  library.returnBook(1); // Error: book already returned

  // Display library state
  library.displayLibraryInfo();
}
```

## 🚀 How to Run
1. 🖥️ Install Dart SDK from [dart.dev](https://dart.dev/get-dart).
2. 📂 Copy the code into a `.dart` file, e.g., `library_management.dart`.
3. 💻 Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.
4. ▶️ Run the program using the command:
   ```
   dart library_management.dart
   ```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- 🗑️ Support for removing books and users.
- 💾 Adding a database or file storage for persistence.
- 🖌️ Enhancing the user interface with a frontend or command-line menu system.
